## Featured Work

### 1) Application of Control Theory to Cruise Control
- What: Rigorous mathematical system analysis, with control design to optimise transient and steady state response
- Why: Show control fundamentals applied to real system, show ability to apply challenging theoretical concept to create real world solution
- See: [/Projects/Application of Control Theory to Cruise Control](/Projects/Application of Control Theory to Cruise Control)

### 2) PHES System Design and Feasibility Study
- What: Multi-disciplinary group report detailing and evaluating a proposed PHES project
- Why: Demonstrates understanding of engineering projects, and the value of storage in the NEM
- See: [/Projects/PHES System Design and Feasibility Study](/Projects/PHES System Design and Feasibility Study)

### 3) Resonance and Excessive Deflection in Pedestrian Bridges
- What: Technical essay analysing excessive deflection of pedestrian bridges due to resonance, and recommending mitigation strategies
- Why: Demonstrates application of technical knowledge to practical problem solving
- See: [/Projects/Resonance and Excessive Deflection in Pedestrian Bridges](/Projects/Resonance and Excessive Deflection in Pedestrian Bridges)

### 4) NEM / ISP Analysis Series (Original writing and Data Analysis)
- What: Short, well sourced pieces on price, generation, and ISP themes
- Why: Demonstrates NEM and Energy literacy, policy understanding and ability to analyse data
- See: [/Writing/ISP NEM Analysis](/Writing/ISP NEM Analysis)

### 5) Policy Briefs
- What: Short policy analysis, breaking down implications for relevant stakeholders and industries
- See: [/Writing/Policy Briefs](/Writing/Policy Briefs)
