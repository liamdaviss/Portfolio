## Featured Work

### 1) Application of Control Theory to Cruise Control
- What: Rigorous mathematical system analysis, with control design to optimise transient and steady state response
- Why: Show control fundamentals applied to real system, show ability to apply challenging theoretical concept to create real world solution
- See: [/Projects/Application-of-Control-Theory-to-Cruise-Control](/Projects/Application-of-Control-Theory-to-Cruise-Control)

### 2) PHES System Design and Feasibility Study
- What: Multi-disciplinary group report detailing and evaluating a proposed PHES project
- Why: Demonstrates understanding of engineering projects, and the value of storage in the NEM
- See: [/Projects/PHES-System-Design-and-Feasibility-Study](/Projects/PHES-System-Design-and-Feasibility-Study)

### 3) Resonance and Excessive Deflection in Pedestrian Bridges
- What: Technical essay analysing excessive deflection of pedestrian bridges due to resonance, and recommending mitigation strategies
- Why: Demonstrates application of technical knowledge to practical problem solving
- See: [/Projects/Resonance-and-Excessive-Deflection-in-Pedestrian-Bridges](/Projects/Resonance-and-Excessive-Deflection-in-Pedestrian-Bridges)

### 4) Retail Net Zero Case Study
- What: Internship Assessment case study analysing the energy usage patterns of a business, and designing a roadmap to net zero emissions through on site PV Solar and a PPA
- Why: Demonstrates ability to integrate load analysis, PV feasibility, PPA structuring, and carbon accounting into cost-optimal decarbonisation strategies as an aspiring renewable energy engineer
- See: [/Projects/Retail-Net-Zero-Case-Study](/Projects/Retail-Net-Zero-Case-Study)

### 5) NEM / ISP Analysis Series (Original writing and Data Analysis)
- What: Short, well sourced pieces on price, generation, and ISP themes
- Why: Demonstrates NEM and Energy literacy, policy understanding and ability to analyse data
- See: [/Writing/ISP-NEM-Analysis](/Writing/ISP-NEM-Analysis)
